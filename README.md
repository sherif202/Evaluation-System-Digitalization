# Project Overview: Transforming Evaluation Systems with ETL, NLP, and Power BI
----


# Overview
This project demonstrates the development of an advanced data evaluation system, transitioning from traditional Excel-based methods to a scalable, data-driven solution. The system ensures transparency and facilitates quality assurance for university education evaluation. Key components include:


# Key Component 

1- ETL Pipeline Development:
- Built using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
- Extracts data from Excel sheets, transforms it to meet university regulations, and loads it into a Microsoft SQL Server database for online operations.
-Data is subsequently moved to a data warehouse for in-depth analysis and reporting.

2- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration:
- Employs machine learning to analyze open-ended feedback.
- Implements sentiment analysis (positive, negative, neutral) to provide deeper insights into qualitative responses.
  
3- Power BI for Visualization:
- Replaces traditional Google Forms with an intuitive Power BI interface.
- Provides dynamic dashboards and reports, offering clear visibility into key evaluation parameters.
- Enhances transparency by allowing stakeholders to interact with real-time data insights directly through Power BI.

# Objective 
This system not only streamlines manual evaluation processes but also serves as a transparent tool to support the university's commitment to high-quality education standards, driving informed decision-making and continuous improvement.
